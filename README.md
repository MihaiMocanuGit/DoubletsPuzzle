# DoubletsPuzzle

This a terminal game
Terminal game made in C++, implementing Lewis Carroll's Doublets puzzle. In this app one begins with two given words, and to solve the puzzle one must find a chain of other words to
link the two. Two adjacent words (that is, words in successive steps) must differ by only one letter. The implementation heavily relies on Graphs to represent all the possible relations between words.
